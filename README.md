# Bike_Sharing_Services
### Bike-sharing services are emerging as a cornerstone of urban mobility—offering sustainable, convenient, and cost-effective transport solutions. However, to operate at scale and meet user expectations, these systems must be guided by data-backed decision-making. This SQL-based analytics case study seeks to evaluate the operational, behavioral, and financial dimensions of a bike-sharing platform by systematically  exploring key business questions. The dataset is logically structured across five interconnected levels: bike trips, stations, users, weather conditions, and maintenance logs. Through the application of advanced SQL techniques—including joins, aggregations, window functions, and conditional logic—the analysis uncovers insights around demand cycles, station performance, revenue generation, rider segmentation, equipment reliability, and risk events. The case study is organized in progressive stages, beginning with data completeness and integrity audits, followed by data refinement, usage pattern discovery, financial deep-dives, maintenance evaluation, and fraud detection. The findings aim to support optimized resource planning, targeted customer strategies, and long-term operational resilience.
